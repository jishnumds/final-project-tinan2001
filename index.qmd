## Introduction

Forest structure plays a critical role in understanding forest biodiversity and ecosystem services (MacKinnon, 2012; Wang et al., 2024). However, measuring forest structure through traditional field data collection is challenging due to time and funding constraints, particularly in large forests. The introduction of remote sensing has been a key driver in obtaining large forest structure data indirectly, while lessening the burden of time and funding limitations (Wulder et al., 2012). In this project, I utilized publicly available remote sensing data to answer a few questions about the Letchworth Teaching Forest's structure and assessed the effectiveness of remote sensing as a stand-alone method for forest structure analysis.

These questions include:

1\. What is the approximate tree population?

2\. Where are the locations of individual trees?

3\. What is the distribution of tree heights in the study site?

4\. Where are the 90% percentile of tallest trees located?

5\. Is there spatial clustering of tall trees?

## Materials and methods

This project utilized the most recent (2019) LiDAR point cloud data (USGS Lidar Point Cloud NY_3County_2019_A19 E1387n2349_2019 - ScienceBase-Catalog, n.d.) to assess vertical forest structure within the Letchworth Learning Forest near the Ellicott Complex. The LiDAR data, originally projected horizontally in NAD83 (2011) and vertically measured in meters, was processed to answer question listed above. Using the lidR and dbscan packages, Z-values from the point-cloud data were filtered and analyzed to identify individual trees, calculate tree heights, and determine spatial clustering of the tallest trees within the study area. The resulting dataset, named `filterOUT_las`, was re-projected into WGS84, enabling tree locations and clustering pattern visualization on an interactive Leaflet map.

Critical R packages utilized in this project included:

[LidR](https://github.com/r-lidar/lidR)

[Leaflet](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet)

[dbscan](https://github.com/mhahsler/dbscan)

Below is the R script:

##### Load Nessassary Packages

```{r Load packages, echo = TRUE, output = FALSE, results = FALSE}
library("sf")
library("terra")
library("lidR")
library("raster")
library("dbscan")
library("tidyverse")
library("leaflet")
library("RColorBrewer")
library("rgl")
library("knitr")
```

```{r output = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
rgl.useNULL=TRUE
knitr::opts_knit$set(global.device = FALSE)
```

##### Load USGS lidar point-cloud data of Letchworth Teaching Forest (las)

```{r Read LiDAR data }
las <- readLAS("data/Letchworth_Teaching_Forest_Lidar.laz")

## Look at the parameter coordinates of original data
original_bbox <- st_bbox(las)

```

##### Create new bounding box filter out non-forested area

```{r Create a new bounding box that only includes the forest area, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide'}
polygon_coords <- matrix(c(
  1388000, 2349355, #right bottom corner
  1388000, 2349700, #right top corner
  1387450, 2349700, #mid top corner
  1387450, 2349450, #mid mid corner
  1387300, 2349200, #left bottom corner
  1387350, 2349200, #mid bottom corner
  1388000, 2349355  #right bottom corner
), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)

## Bounding Box has been given CRS associated with las-CRS 
polygon_sf <- st_sfc(st_polygon(list(polygon_coords)),  crs = st_crs(las))

```

##### Create new parameter for las called filterOUT_las

```{r Crop orinigal data by bounding box and filter out vertical outliers, echo = TRUE, output = FALSE, results = FALSE}
las_clipped <- lidR::clip_roi(las, polygon_sf)

## Check if the crs is still the same
st_crs(polygon_sf) == st_crs(las)

## Filter out any OUTliers z-values from las
filterOUT_las <- filter_poi(las_clipped, Z >= 190, Z <= 220)

```

##### GIF of the filterOUT_las

```{r Lidar Point-Cloud Data, out.width = "300px", fig.align = "center"}
# plot(filterOUT_las)
# movie3d(spin3d(axis = c(0, 0, 1), rpm = 2,), duration = 5, movie = "data/lidar")

knitr::include_graphics("data/letch.gif", error = FALSE)
```

##### Check if new data will correctly transform to leaflet projection. Original data (las) used NAD83 (2011) projection and Leaflet uses WGS84 projection

```{r Test to see if the clipped data will correctly change to leaflet crs, warning = F}
## Reproject the las to 4326 for Leaflet
options(digits = 15)
las84 <- st_as_sf(las_clipped, coords = c("X", "Y"), crs = 26918) # crs was NAD83(2011)
las84 <- st_transform(las_clipped, crs = 4326)


## Create a dataframe of points lat and long to check if st_transform worked  
las_df <- data.frame(lat = st_coordinates(las84)[, 2],
                     long = st_coordinates(las84)[, 1])
unique(las_df$lat)
unique(las_df$long)
```

##### Rasterize filterOUT_las to find trees, tree tops, and tree population. Then, create a new data set called tall_trees containg the 90th percentile of trees based on hieght(m)

```{r Rasterize data, and find the 90 percent trees, results = 'hide'}
## LidR functions to find individual trees
chm <- rasterize_canopy(filterOUT_las, 0.25, pitfree(subcircle = 1))

tree_tops <- locate_trees(chm, lmf (ws=5))
filtered_tree_tops <- tree_tops %>%
filter(Z >= 190)

#plot(chm, col = height.colors(50))
#plot(sf::st_geometry(filtered_tree_tops), pch = 3)
#plot(sf::st_geometry(filtered_tree_tops), add = TRUE, pch = 3)

nintypercent <- quantile(filtered_tree_tops$Z, 0.90)
tall_trees <- filtered_tree_tops[filtered_tree_tops$Z > nintypercent,]

coords <- st_coordinates(tall_trees)
```

##### Using ggplot2 package to show the tree hieght distribution and population in study area.

```{r making a histogram of height distribution}
tree_Z <- as.data.frame(filtered_tree_tops$Z)
colnames(tree_Z) <- c("height")
ind_trees <- tree_Z$height - 190
ind_trees <- as.data.frame(ind_trees)

tall_trees_height <- as.data.frame(tall_trees$Z - 190)
colnames(tall_trees_height) <- c("height")
## in meters

mean <- mean(ind_trees$ind_trees)
mean <- round(mean, 2)
subtitle = paste("Total trees = ", nrow(ind_trees), " trees \nMean (Blue) = ", mean,"\n90% of tallest trees (Red)")

ggplot()+
geom_histogram(data = ind_trees, aes(x = ind_trees), binwidth = 0.5,, color = "black", fill="green", alpha = 0.25)+
geom_histogram(data = tall_trees_height, aes(x = height), binwidth = 0.5,, color = "black", fill="red", alpha = .5)+
geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ind_trees$ind_trees)), color="blue", linetype="dashed", linewidth=1)+
theme_classic()+
labs(title = "Distribution of Tree Heights in Meters", x = "Height (m)", y = "Frequency",
     subtitle = subtitle,
     caption = "Letchworth Teaching Forest (2019)")
```

```{r tree height tables}
allT <- as.data.frame (filtered_tree_tops)
allT$Z <- allT$Z - 190
allT$Z <- formatC(allT$Z, 2)
kable(allT[1:10,], col.names = c("Tree ID", "Height (m)", "Location"), align = ("ccc"), caption = "First 10 Tree Heights (m)")

ninT <- as.data.frame(tall_trees)
ninT$Z <- tall_trees$Z - 190
ninT$Z <- formatC(ninT$Z)
kable(ninT[1:10,1:3], col.names = c("Tree ID", "Height (m)", "Location"), align = ("ccc"), caption = "First 10 90th Percentile Tree Heights (m)")
```

##### Locate the tallest trees, and tree tops within the study area

```{r warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(global.device = TRUE)

plot(chm, main = "Tree Tops")
plot(filtered_tree_tops[2],pch = 16, cex = .5, main = "tree_tops", add = TRUE)

plot(chm, main = "Tallest (90%) Trees")
plot(tall_trees, pch = 16, cex = .5, main = "tall_trees", add = TRUE)

```

##### Locate spatial clustering of tallest trees

```{r Findind spatial clustering}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(global.device = TRUE)

dbscan_result <- dbscan(coords, eps = 12, minPts = 5)

tall_trees$dbscan_cluster <- as.factor(dbscan_result$cluster)
colorsize = length (unique (tall_trees$dbscan_cluster))


## Filter out first cluster
cluster <- tall_trees %>%
filter(dbscan_cluster != 0)
plot(chm)
plot(cluster[3], pch = 16, cex = .5, col = factor(cluster$dbscan_cluster), main = "Tree Clusters", add = TRUE)

```

##### Add locations of spatial clustering to leaflet map

```{r Project onto leaflet map, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
pal <- colorFactor(brewer.pal(4, "Set1"), domain = tall_trees$dbscan_cluster)

st_tall_trees <- st_transform(tall_trees, crs = 4326)

st_tall_trees_filtered <- st_tall_trees %>%
  filter(dbscan_cluster != 0)
st_tall_trees_filtered$Z <- st_tall_trees_filtered$Z - 180


leaflet (st_tall_trees_filtered) %>%
  setView(lng = -78.793, lat = 43.007, zoom = 15)  %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    radius = 2,
    color = ~pal(dbscan_cluster),
    popup = ~paste("Tree ID:", treeID, "<br> Height (m):", Z,"<br> Coordinates:", geometry))

```

##### Load any required packages in a code chunk:

```{r Packages, warning=F, echo = TRUE, output = FALSE}
 #install.packages("sf")
 #install.packages("terra")
 #install.packages("lidR")
 #install.packages("raster")
 #install.packages("dbscan")
 #install.packages("tidyverse")
 #install.packages("leaflet")
 #install.packages("RColorBrewer")
 #install.packages("knitr")
 #install.packages("rgl")

```

## Conclusions

This study demonstrates the potential of using remote sensing data to assess forest structure with promising results. The analysis indicates a total of approximately 2,018 trees, with individual tree locations identified. Spatial clustering of the tallest trees were observed in six areas. The overall average height across the entire tree population was found to be 13.02 meters. It is important to note that the results , derived solely from remote sensing data and computational analysis, offer only a rough estimate of forest structure characteristics. For more precise and reliable conclusions, incorporating field data is essential to provide a reference for validating the remote sensing analysis.

In conclusion, while remote sensing provides a faster method for assessing forest characteristics, the inclusion of field data is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. Combining both approaches will offer a more comprehensive understanding of forest dynamics.
